# LightAR 
##/ˈlīdər/

LightAR is a project to control Philips Hue lights using an Augmented reality interface.

This project combines ARToolkit for Android as the tracker for AR and the philips hue demo example to simplify control.

It is also intended to use jPCT-AE to load the models that are to be shown on the AR scene.

Currently it is just a mashup of all the code needed to work.
